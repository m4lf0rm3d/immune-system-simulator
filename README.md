# Human Immune System Simulator

## Overview

The **Human Immune System Simulator** is an interactive simulation of the body's immune response to bacterial infections, built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**. It employs **Ant Colony Optimization (ACO)** principles to model **white blood cell (WBC)** behavior as they chase and eliminate bacteria.

## Simulator

Play with the simulator using this ([Human Immune System Simulator](https://m4lf0rm3d.github.io/immune-system-simulator/)).

## Features

- Simulates bacterial growth and white blood cell (WBC) response.
- Adjustable parameters for WBC speed, bacteria speed, and growth rate.
- Cytokine-based communication modeled with ACO-inspired behavior.
- Real-time simulation with dynamic visual feedback.
- Fully responsive UI with dark mode design.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML, CSS, JavaScript** for frontend development.
- **Canvas API** for rendering real-time simulation.
- **ACO-based behavior** for immune response modeling.

## Installation & Usage

Clone this repository:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/m4lf0rm3d/human-immune-system-simulator.git
```

Navigate to the project folder:

```sh
cd human-immune-system-simulator
```

Open `index.html` in a browser to run the simulation.

## Controls

- **WBC Speed**: Adjusts the movement speed of white blood cells.
- **Bacteria Speed**: Adjusts how fast bacteria move.
- **Bacteria Growth Rate**: Defines how quickly bacteria multiply.
- **Cytokine Evaporation Rate**: Controls pheromone decay over time.
- **Bacteria Count**: Sets the initial number of bacteria.
- **WBC Count**: Defines the initial count of immune cells.
- **Reset Button**: Resets all parameters to default.
- **Update Button**: Applies new parameter values.
